     h1.w3-center 45 DAYS FOOD DISTRIBUTION DRIVE
     p
       | We believe that the best time to prove yourself is when the odds are not in your favour. And so we did. Sharva Foundation has successfully clinched yet another milestone through severe hardships and defeated the odds. This marks the conclusion of our 40 days of Food Donation drive organised and initiated around date. These 40 days tested our patience and with each passing day gave us more reason to continue our work with dedication. The volunteers of Sharva Foundation and the help incorporated with donations and manpower led to the inevitable victory over our tasks even during the peak of the gruesome second wave of Coronavirus in India. All this could only be made possible due to the intense dedication of our volunteers and the help and donations that we encountered along the way. If we were able to help even a single person by not letting them starve themselves, we would consider this mission a job well executed. But we do not stop here. Helping someone is an untimely task and it is our duty not to turn our backs on the people that need our help. We assure you that we will contribute to our society in every way possible in the times to come for the help we innovate today paved the future of our society. Join us in our mission and witness us make this world a better place than we found it. Join our family today!
