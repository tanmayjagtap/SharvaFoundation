We take care of necessary precautions while doing our ventures as well as limit our staff to tha former. The safety of our family is our top priority at this moment, and we take at most precautions to do the same. This is the most sensitive time for the people that we aim to focus and we will not let this venture confine our goals.

        | Sharva Foundation dignifies giving by using urban surplus materials as a tool for urban development. We focus at providing raw food items like grains and rice to the families that are unable or underprivileged to acquire this commodity. The distribution happens to the selected areas where this condition exists. We feel that not a single person should sleep with an empty stomach and we do our best to take care of it.

        | Education is the foundation of one’s life and character. We find it extremely important that every child must have a proper basic education. This helps them to embark on a better path in their lives. Our team focuses on being able to entitle children with basic education by sending them to schools as well as making sure that they continue. Everyday we are exploring ways in which we can improve our execution and are coming up with ideas. An educated India is our vision and we do our part in doing so.
